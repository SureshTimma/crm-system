# Cloudinary Image Upload - Setup Complete ✅

## What's Been Implemented

### 🔧 Backend Integration
- **Cloudinary SDK**: Installed and configured for image uploads
- **Profile API**: Enhanced to handle image uploads to Cloudinary
- **Database Schema**: Updated User model to store Cloudinary URLs and public IDs
- **Image Management**: Automatic deletion of old images when updating

### 🖼️ Image Upload Features
- **File Validation**: Max 5MB size, image types only
- **Image Optimization**: Auto-resized to 400x400px with face detection
- **Cloud Storage**: Images stored on Cloudinary CDN
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Better user feedback during upload

### 🔐 Environment Variables Required
Make sure your `.env.local` file contains:

**Option 1: Single URL format (recommended)**
```bash
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://api_key:api_secret@cloud_name
```

**Option 2: Individual credentials (alternative)**
```bash
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
```

> **Note**: The system supports both formats. Use whichever you have from your Cloudinary dashboard.

## How It Works

4. Sent to `/api/auth/profile` endpoint
5. Server uploads to Cloudinary
6. Cloudinary URL saved to MongoDB
7. Old image deleted from Cloudinary (if exists)

### 2. Image Storage Structure
